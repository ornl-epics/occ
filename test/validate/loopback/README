occ_validation.py [-d <occ device> -r <repeat count> -hv]

Options:
  -d <occ device>    : Defaults to /dev/snsocb0
  -r <repeat count>  : Number of times to test each input file
  -h                 : Print help (this file)
  -v                 : Verbose mode (prints stdout from occ_loopback)

This Python program is an automated validation test of the OCC card and 
software, using occ_loopback.

The validation program will run occ_loopback for each of the input binary files
contained in the /validation_test_files directory, subject to certain filename 
conventions which must be followed, described below.

FILENAME CONVENTIONS:

If the filename contains the text "raw", the '-r' flag will be appended
to the occ_loopback command line to indicate raw mode processing (i.e., the
binary file contains DAS packets).

The filename must be suffixed with ".vlt" (as in validation loopback test) in
order for the validation program to process the file.
