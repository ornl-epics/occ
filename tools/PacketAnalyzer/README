This is a Windows counterpart of the PacketAnalyzer. It Analyzes laboratory-generated
DAS packets. It will dump bad packets in the same format as Windows version does.
While running, it will also print some statistics with 10Hz refresh rate.

Sources can be compiled with simple `make' command. There's also Code::Blocks project
that can be used for editing and compiling the same sources.
