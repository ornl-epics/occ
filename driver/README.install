SNS OCB driver can be installed to system location to get loaded automatically
when system boots. Runing 'make install' will create following files:
* /etc/snsocb/snsocb0-sample
* /etc/udev/rules.d/95-snsocb.rules.sample
* /etc/sysconfig/modules/snsocb.modules
* /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/sns-ocb<VER>.ko
* /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/sns-ocb.ko

/etc/udev/rules.d/95-snsocb.rules.sample file needs to be renamed to
/etc/udev/rules.d/95-snsocb.rules in order to fix device files permissions
every time driver is loaded. Furthermore the file can be changed to use
persistent device names. By default driver creates /dev/snsocbX devices where X
is the sequence numberi of found device. When cards are moved around they might
get assigned differenti device names. Using udev rules it's possible to make a
persistent alias name based on the serial number of the OCC FPGA.

In order to permanently change device parameters, use /etc/snsocb/snsocb0.sample
as a template and make a copy of it in /etc/snsocb directory following device
name from /dev (not an alias name). Then modify the file and tweak any settings.
Driver will use the file every time it loads.
