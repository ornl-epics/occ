Description:
		Tweak number of interrupts produced by the OCC board.

		By default the OCC board interrupts for every OCC packet.
		Handling the interrupt involves context switching that could
		cause severe performance impact. By grouping several OCC
		packets into one interrupt performance can be much improved.
		When grouping is enabled, interrupt is asserted once per
		number of packets configured or for the last subpacket,
		whichever comes first. Command packets always interrupt.

What:		/sys/class/snsocc/<devname>/device/dma_big_mem
Date:		September 2014

Description:
		Use of boot-time reserved memory.

		Support for >2MB DMA buffer is done by dedicating some memory to the
		driver by reserving it at boot time using memmap= kernel parameter.
		This file has similar syntax but it applies to specific device rather
		than whole driver. File can be writen only when device is not in use.
		Write <size>M$<offset>M to the file, for example 128M$1024M. The size
		must be power of two and the offset must be memory page aligned. See
		PAGE_SIZE on your system for exact value, usually 4096 bytes.
