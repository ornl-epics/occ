Description:
		Tweak number of interrupts produced by the OCC board.

		By default the OCC board interrupts for every OCC packet.
		Handling the interrupt involves context switching that could
		cause severe performance impact. By grouping several OCC
		packets into one interrupt performance can be much improved.
		When grouping is enabled, interrupt is asserted once per
		number of packets configured or for the last subpacket,
		whichever comes first. Command packets always interrupt.
